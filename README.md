### Welcome to my profile!
I'm a master's student in Data-Centric Engineering and my studies focus on Applied Mathematics. I will specialize in computational statistics.

## Course projects
Here are some of my course projects that I have completed during my studies.
| Title | Description | Link | Languages |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Open hashing** | In the course _Data Structures and Algorithms_, I created a hash table data structure which utilizes open hashing. | [Project](https://github.com/ToniKoskinen/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Course-Project) |[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py)](https://skillicons.dev) |
| **Statistic portal: Munipal election data**| In the course _Introduction to Web Programming_, I created a website that visualizes results of municipal elections in Finland from 1992 to 2021. The election data is fetched from Tilastokeskus API. | [Project](https://github.com/ToniKoskinen/Introduction-to-Web-Programming-Course-Project) [Website](https://tonikoskinen.github.io/Introduction-to-Web-Programming-Course-Project/) |[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css)](https://skillicons.dev) | 
|**A native prototype for a crocery store application**| In the course _User Interfaces and Usability_, I implemented a native prototype for a crocery store app. React and Materialize CSS frameworks were utilized to build the necessary components of the prototype. | [Repository](https://github.com/ToniKoskinen/uiu_demo/tree/original) [Demo](https://tonikoskinen.github.io/uiu_demo/) | [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react)](https://skillicons.dev)|
| **NHL database** | This project was made in collaboration with [Eero Ryh√§nen](https://github.com/eeroryha). In the course _Basics of database systems_, we created a database which stores information and advanced statistics of NHL players and teams. We also implemented a simple Python interface to demonstrate different database queries. | [Project](https://github.com/eeroryha/DBS-Harkkaty-/tree/main) |[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=sqlite,py)](https://skillicons.dev)| 
| **Operating Systems and System Programming** | In the course _Operating Systems and System programming_, I completed three small Unix-related projects such as building a simple Unix shell.|[Project](https://github.com/ToniKoskinen/Operating-Systems-and-System-Programming---Course-project/tree/main)|[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=c)](https://skillicons.dev)|
